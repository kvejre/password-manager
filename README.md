# Password Manager 
- Every record in this db is encrypted using master password hence when someone else checks the db they can't view your password. You can only view it if you have the correct master password.
- Each record can have different master password.
- Dummy data entered has master password as test@123.
- You can remove environment variable dependency by hard coding the salt value of your choice.
